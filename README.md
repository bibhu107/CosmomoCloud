## Overview

This project is a user management system that provides APIs to perform several actions such as creating and listing
users, creating and listing organizations, and setting permissions and modifying permission for users on each
organization.

## Problem Statement

You need to build an Access Control / User Management System which needs the features mentioned below. You have to build
APIs for each of these features so that frontend / client can call these APIs and accomplish the task -

1. Create a new User
    - Should have ID, Name, and email. ID can be auto-generated or manually generated.
2. List all users in the system
    - Can filter on the user's name.
    - Should implement pagination using limit & offset, and return the total count of records in each API response, no
      matter what limit.
3. Fetch a single User
4. Create a new Organisation
    - Organisation is a simple bucket entity that can be identified similarly to a Github Organization.
    - Organizations will just have a unique name. No 2 organizations can have the same name.
5. List an organization
    - Can filter on the orgâ€™s name.
    - Should implement pagination using limit & offset, and return the total count of records in each API response, no
      matter what limit.
6. Create / Update permissions for Users on each Organization
    - Each User can have access to multiple organizations.
    - Each organization can have multiple users having access to the same.
    - Each User can have different access levels - READ, WRITE, ADMIN
    - Can be a singular API or bulk update/create API - up to you.
7. Remove / Delete permissions for Users on each Organization
    - Can be a singular API or bulk update/create API - up to you.

## Tech Stack Allowed

- Python - FastAPI (preferred), Django or Flask - Mandatory to be python 3
- MongoDB as a database - Using Pymongo / Motor driver, not Django ORM.
- Would not need any other 3rd party libraries, but you can use some simple add ons if required by your solution - No
  major hacks.

This API provides functionality for managing user information.



#### Create User

Creates a new user in the system.

**Request**

`POST` -
`http://localhost:8000/users`

```
{
    "name": "Bibhu Pala",
    "email": "bibhu.pala@example.com",
    "password": "bibhu_123"
}
```

**Response**

```
{
    "name": "Bibhu Pala",
    "email": "bibhu.pala@example.com",

    "data": [
        {
            "name": "Bibhu Pala",
            "email": "bibhu.pala@example.com",
            "id": "644614d25e247e93b662c3e1",
            "organization_access": null
        }
    ]

```

2. Adding offset,limit,and name

**Request**

`GET` - `http://localhost:8000/users?name=Bibhu&limit=1&offset=0`

## Database modelling
### sample user collection
```[
  {
    "_id": {"$oid": "644614d25e247e93b662c3e1"},
    "created_at": "2023-04-24 11:04:10",

```
USER collection has information of Organization it's related with and access_level it has for the organization.
Organization collection stores the users that are part of the organization.
